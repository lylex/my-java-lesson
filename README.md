## My Java Lesson

### About this project

**I suggest you to leave because it may borther you if you want to continue to read my dumb story.**

I have no knowledge about Java and I have no intrest in it. But I have to write a plugin for some tool I am using, and it has to be written in Java. I do not want to say I can learn Java in a week because this exaggeration may embarrass me, but I only afford about a week to study it before I can use to write the plugin. What's worse, I only have some spare time for it.

Why I write it here? Well, it is an expreiment which I used to track the learning in a new way rather than use my notebook. I believe if I log the learning process here I will feel supervised by others, so that I will become less lazy.
